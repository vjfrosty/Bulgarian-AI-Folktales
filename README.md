## Main Idea

   The project excels in creating innovative educational tool that blend storytelling, cultural heritage, and advanced artificial intelligence. We focus on the foundational concepts of storytelling and the key technologies that make our interactive storytelling bot a unique educational resource for children aged 3-12.

By integrating traditional Bulgarian folklore with modern AI technology, we provide a seamless storytelling experience that is both culturally relevant and educationally impactful.
The application builds collaboratively, engaging and educational narratives that convey positive values and lessons to children.  

Story materials can help children to have early exposure to domain knowledge and some universal principles of human society in diverse and dramatic scenarios. Interactive storytelling is a flexible and effective educational method that integrates storytelling with childrenâ€™s participation, and it has been widely applied in teaching activities for preschool and elementary school children

## Installation 
https://github.com/vjfrosty/Bulgarian-AI-Folktales/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md
  
##  Building steps
**[Source information and preprocesing](https://github.com/vjfrosty/Bulgarian-AI-Folktales/blob/main/PREPROCESING.md)** We are working with 28 books of Bulgarian folklore fairy tales, sourced from Chitanka.info. These books feature well-known authors such as Elin Pelin, Angel Karalijchev, Leda Mileva, and others. Each book is processed using a custom function that separates the individual stories, and the resulting data is saved into JSON files. 


**[Embedding](https://github.com/vjfrosty/Bulgarian-AI-Folktales/blob/main/EMBEDING.md)** This system embeds documents with contextual information and stores them in a Chroma vector database. It handles both small (60-1000 tokens) and large (1000+ tokens) documents differently.


## Key tech

  

**Text Embedding and Retrieval**: We utilize advanced text embedding techniques and a vector store to access a diverse collection of Bulgarian folklore tales. This ensures that our AI has a broad cultural and linguistic context during story creation, providing rich, authentic narratives.

  

**AI-Powered Co-Creation**: Our platform leverages state-of-the-art language models to co-create stories with parents and teachers. This interactive approach ensures active engagement and allows for the imparting of specific educational goals, such as teaching positive behavior and moral lessons.

  




  

## Product Features

  

**Interactive Storytelling Bot**: An AI character that continues the story based on the child's feedback, embedding positive values relevant to Bulgarian culture and language.

  

**Customized Narratives**: Stories are tailored to the child's interests and the educational goals of the parent or teacher, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

**Cultural Enrichment**: Incorporation of Bulgarian folklore enriches the storytelling process, preserving cultural heritage while educating the younger generation.

  

## Target audience

  

Our primary audience includes parents, educators, and institutions seeking innovative educational tools that promote positive values and cultural awareness among children aged 2-12. The product is particularly suited for those interested in Bulgarian culture and language.

  

## How It the App  works

  

**Initiation**: The parent or educator provides a theme or context for the story.

  

**Contextual Retrieval**: Our AI retrieves relevant folklore elements from the Chroma vector store, ensuring cultural and linguistic appropriateness.

  

**Interactive Dialogue**: The AI engages with the parent through open-ended questions, shaping the narrative based on their input.

  
  
  
  

**Story Development**: The story evolves through a cycle of feedback and AI-generated content, incorporating positive values and moral lessons.

  

**Conclusion**: The story concludes with a moral lesson, reinforcing the educational goals and prompting further discussion between parent and child.

  

## Benefits
